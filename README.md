# rehash-install
Works on: Debian 8?

# Introduction
Rehash is a fork of slash, located @ https://github.com/SoylentNews/rehash : the code that powers SoylentNews.org. This script aids (poorly) in installing rehash on a fresh debian box, for testing purposes.

# Information
Be warned : This is extremely experimental and only for disposable development setups.
That being said, it should be faster than following the typical INSTALL procedure as outlined in original slash docs.

# Notes
This MIGHT work on other (debian-based) distributions.

Install
-----
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mecctro/rehash-install/master/install.sh &&
    chmod -x install.sh &&
    sh install.sh
