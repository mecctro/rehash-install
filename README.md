# rehash-install

Works on: Debian 8

# Information
Be warned : This is extremely experimental and only for disposable development setups.
That being said, it should be faster than following the typical INSTALL procedure as outlined in original slash docs.

Install
-----
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mecctro/rehash-install/master/install.sh &&
    chmod -x install.sh &&
    sh install.sh
